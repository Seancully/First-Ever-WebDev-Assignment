                    <p>
                        This website entails of my own gym idealogies and also ideas. Everything that you see comes from
                        my own mind and also my heart. It strives to also help non gym goers understand the contents of 
                        what the gym lifestyle contains and what they can learn from it. It shows what they can learn of how
                        it benefits them, different programs, benefits of the gym, different training methods in the gym and 
                        also a little bit about myself and my own gym journey. Furthermore, it has a gym related form and also
                        gym related questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The archetypical user of this site may be somebody who has an interest in getting started in the gym but
                       does not yet know where to start. They might have a previous or current interest in sport and wish to take
                       their game to the next level by incorporating gym workouts. They may either be someone who has zero experience
                       of any sport or any fitness related activities, however they may want to make a change in their life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem that this site solves is it may offer some motivation for those who have either lost interest in
                        the gym or those who are quite nervous or anxious to begin their gym journey. Those who wish to learn more about
                        the gym may also have their problems solved for this site is very factual and everything stated is true.

                    <h2>2. Research</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first website I researched was thegymltd.ie. It is the website of the gym i currently go to. It is
                        also known as the "mecca" as it is the best gym in the country as voted by many people. It has an excellent
                        site layout and also site content. This is where I took my initial inspiration from for my own website.
                        I tried to create something similar to the site layout with the nav bar and also something similar with the
                        site content where I included videos and pictures of myself inside the gym like the trainers in the website.
                    </p><br>

                        <span>Figure 1. Homepage of The Gym</span><br>
                    <p>
                       The second website that I researched was healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise. This is where I grabbed
                        some inspiration for the benefits of working out in the gym. The first benefit this website had was that exercise
                        makes you feel better. The site content here with this has helped me to create a centre of importance of the benefits
                        on the mental state of working out. However I really did not like the site layout as it did not appeal as very
                        aesthetically pleasing to me.     
                    </p><br>

                        <span>Figure 2. Homepage of Healthline</span><br>
                    <p>
                        The third website that I researched was westwood.ie. This is one of the best gyms in dublin and it had a really nice
                        site layout and also site content. In particular I really took some inspiration from the site content as the page was very 
                        informative just like how I had wanted mine to be. This is the reason as to why my own website holds lots of important 
                        information regarding the gym and exercise.
                    </p><br>

                    <h2>3. Technology Selection and Site Architecture </h2>
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The version of HTML that my website used was developed in HTML5 and the version of CSS that was used
                        was CSS3. These are the two most recent versions that are available to the general public and so I felt like
                        they would be the two best equipped versions to incorporate my websites needs.
                        My plan for the site layout was to include the same header picture that matched the overall theme of the website
                        as a whole. It would also include a navigation bar that would allow you to access all 7 of the web pages in the 
                        website. Below this will include a heading that shall be on every single page with another smaller heading below
                        stating the page name. All pages will have this similar look and feel, but every pages contents will vary depending 
                        on the pages title. My plan for responsive design was to use media queries that would allow the web page to look and feel
                        quite different on different devices and screen sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We expect users to view the web page on any screen size as many are available to most users. This meant that it was
                        vital that I included media queries that would allow the web page to look and feel as it should on each corresponding device.
                        Media queries change the CSS styling of the page depending on the screen sizes which allow for easier use of the web pages depending on the
                        device the user wishes to view the site on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to keep my website cross browser compatible I ensured I kept my HTML markup simple along with my CSS styling and also my 
                        javascript. This is to ensure that the web pages are completely cross-browser compatible. I also made sure that my forms and also quiz were validated.
                        I made sure to set my doctype to html. Last but not least I also made sure to link all my web pages to the javascript and css pages. This was to ensure
                        all browsers shall allow the css and javascript along with the html.

                        This is how the main 5 pages of my website will look like. This is a lo fidelity prototype of the web pages. It is not intended to be
                        exactly how the web pages will look like. However, it is used to create the basis of my ideas for the web pages. These web pages have since
                        been created and to be frankly honest they look like they are an exact carbon copy of the wireframes/prototypes.

                    <h2>5. Development Plan </h2>
                    <p>
                        The site was initially hard to think of an idea to base upon. However I thought to turn to what do I love about
                        my free time. I settled on the gym and exercise as it is a huge part of my life and I want to inspire others to follow
                        and start their own gym journey. So I decided to take a look at my own gym's website and it is quite an amazing one if I do say
                        so. It gave me great inspiration and motivation to emulate my own similar approach and ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began my own HTML markup of the first page after creating the relevant folders for the assignment. This was the easy part,
                        getting started with the project and thr HTML markup. I had 5 identical pages created and I was quite happy with their looks after
                        the css styling i had also created and linked. I then began to work away and make sure I had all of the needed HTML tags for the assignment.
                        These were then styled to my own desire. This was all done to incorporate the ideas of what I wanted aswell.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I had the 5 pages with the HTML and CSS that I was satisfied with then I moved onto creating a 6th page for a form using Javascript.
                        This was the most difficult part of my project and it was definitely the most strenuous and too, time consuming. I then added a quiz and
                        rotating images using javascript too. Once this was all created and styled how I wanted it to be I got to work on the last page, which is this page
                        the report.

                    <h2>6. Testing Plan </h2>
                    <p>
                        Explain in detail the strategies used to test the website. (eg. HTML validation, CSS validation).
                        Is the site Cross Browser Compatible?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used a HTML validator from W3C to test the website's html validation. This was done to make sure that my HTML markup had
                        no errors and that it was not leading astray to the HTML standards needed and set by W3C. This was done to make sure that
                        my HTML worked well with the web pages and ensured the website was working properly and as desired by me for the users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CSS validation was done the exact same way however, it was with my css file instead of my html file. This ensured that my CSS was up to standard and that it had no errors too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A combination of the HTML and also CSS validation was to ensure there was no errors in either of my languages.
                        Having no errors allows every single browser to run the website as normal without any issues. This means that the web pages are all
                        cross-browser compatible. For example if I have an error in my markup my web page might run normally on google chrome but possibly not on firefox.
                        This is why I made sure that I validated both of my languages to ensure there was no errors.

                    <h2>7. Site Evaluation </h2>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first way that I evaluated my website was through the heuristic of user control and freedom. I ensured that no user will find themselves in places
                        that they do not expect whilst browsing my website. I have each page labelled correctly along with the navigation bar too. I also have the page number of each
                        page at the bottom of each page to ensure the user does not find themselves to be lost. Each page clearly shows where the user is and the navigation bar proves
                        to be a quick and easy way of navigating through the pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second way that I evaluated the website was through the use of the heuristic of consistency and standards. This means that the site layout on each page remained very
                        alike to other pages on the web and also felt true to the other pages on my website. This ensured that I kept a good standard and also consistency throughout the entire website.
                        I felt as though the website was designed well and any user should find the usability of the website to be fairly simple to navigate and find any of the content of the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third way that I evaluated the website was through the use of the heuristic of match between system and the real world. I ensured that any text on my website
                        did not use gym jargon. This was to ensure that each and every user could understand the meaning of anything stated in the website. It allowed them to be familiar with the meaning of
                        every single thing in the website. All information about the gym and exercise was shown in the website to the users in a clear and easy to comprehend way.
