                <h3>What Are The Different Training Methods?</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>(1) Strength Training</h4>
                <p>
                    Strength training is a certain type of training where mainly the sets and repetitions remain a low amount, with higher weight than other forms of training. This is to expose the body to heavy weight for short periods of time in order to be stronger over time. The lesser amount of reps and sets allows for less stress as a result of using higher weight. Strength training also has a much higher amount of time rest in between working sets often upwards of 3+ minutes. This is also to limit the stress put under the body from the heavy weight. Please see below me performing strength training on bench press.

                <h4>(2) Endurance Training</h4>
                <p>
                    Endurance training is a method of training that primarily focuses on cardiovascular health and getting a high heartbeat bmp. It involves much lighter weight than strength training and also progressive overload training but a much higher rep range often much above 20+ reps per set. This is to create blood flow into the muscles and increase the average bmp of the heart throughout the workout. This proves how weight training can be useful in increasing cardiovascular health. this method of training is also extremely useful if trying to lose weight but not trying to lose too much muscle. Please see below me performing endurance training on cable chest flye's.

                <h4>(3) Progressive Overload Training</h4>
                <p>
                    Progressive Overload is arguably the most popular method of training in the gym. It is certainly my most favoured method. It involves a medium set and rep ranges. Repetitions generally do be between 8-12 per set. This is because this rep range is the most optimal for building muscle. The main aim of progressive overloading is to build as much lean muscle as possible within a certain time frame. It got it's name from its literal use. This method involves making each session a tiny bit harder than the previous. For example if Monday I train a push day and bench 60kg for 8 reps then by the following Monday I will strive to hit it for 9 reps. This is what progressive overloading is all about. It causes the muscles to constantly evolve to having to endure a harder workout. This causes the muscle tissues to continue to break down so they can rebuild back bigger and stronger. Hence why it is the most optimal training method for putting on muscle in my own honest opinion. Please see below me performing progressive overload training on incline dumbbell press.
