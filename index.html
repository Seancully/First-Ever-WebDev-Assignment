                <h3>Why weightlifting?</h3>
                <p>
                    Weightlifting is my favourite thing to do in the whole wide world. I feel as though every single person that is capable of doing so should definitely incorporate some form of resistance training in their life. It truly has a very special place in my own heart and it is something I am deeply passionate about. The aim of this entire webpage will simply be to document my own fitness journey so far and also to give people who have not much of an idea about working out a glimpse into what it is really all about. I wish to help to try remove the stigma around gym goers being arrogant and cocky and show how they generally are some of the nicest people on the planet. Everyone has their reasons for working out and this webpage will let every reader know that any reason to workout is a good enough of a reason. Ive dedicated so much of my life to date since the age of 14 to weightlifting and I want this website to show who i truly am as a person. It's what I love currently and it's what I will always love. I just hope by you reading this you may either atleast understand why people like me love it so much, or maybe even you yourself may begin to love the fitness industry. As a man who truly inspires me called Brandon stated in one of his youtube videos says "If I don't go to the gym I feel down, so I gotta go to the gym to let all my emotions out on the iron instead of on those who i truly love".
                        Why don't you, yes you reading this take this opportunity to think to yourself why do I not workout when I can? Every single person out there has the same 24 hours in the day that you have. A tiny amount of training is better than none. Think of how much better you will feel after letting all your emotions out instead of either keeping them inside or letting them out on someone you love. Fitness is a crazy world it can change relationships, mental states everything imaginable. So give these 5 web pages on this website a read and try and tell me you don't want to begin your fitness journey afterwards. I bet you can't.
