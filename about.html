                        When I initially started to lift weights I was not long turned 14 years old. I had such a huge interest in sports so i thought why not? I genuinely think to this day that is still the greatest decision I have ever taken in my whole life. I took that leap into the world of fitness and to be fair it did indeed keep me dragged in. I fell in love with it pretty quickly. I struggled for the first few months, I was a very skinny young teenager with not much strength or a good grasp of how to even train effectively. However, I believed I could do anything I could put my mind to. So I began to do some research, particularly on youtube. I watched hundreds of videos of different training methods and techniques, correct form for exercises and nutrition. Combining all of this with my will power and desire to change myself both physically and too, mentally change was bound to happen.
                        I learned so, so much from different fitness Youtuber's I honestly wish I could return all of their favours somehow. I have never needed a personal trainer/coach ever as a result of all of this research I have done since I was a very young teenager. The main reason I wanted this change so bad was because I wasn't happy with my body I was very tall and skinny for my age and I did not like what I seen in the mirror, like many don't. I made the change and I am very proud of my progress to date but never ever satisfied. Some people tell me that I am too addicted to the gym, I like to tell them "best addiction one could possibly have". The gym gives me a constant goal I can strive to reach every single workout, to be better than my previous workout.

                        Now that I am a little less than 5 years into my fitness journey I am using this assignment as a reflection method here for myself too. The gym really has changed me for the better in so many ways. I'm no longer the tall lanky/skinny kid in school. My mental health has skyrocketed, I feel at peace in the gym and after i've completed my workout. I am currently lifting 6 days a week because it makes me so happy. I really am so glad little 14 year old me rose to the occasion and became as addicted as I am now with fitness. Everyone has their battles inside their head but I can guarantee you this, everyone's battles get that little bit smaller after a good workout. It takes my mind off of fears, anxiety and sadness. i use it as a coping strategy for anything that ever doesn't go my way and I am so proud of myself for creating my own way of dealing with things through fitness. 
                        I have progressed drastically over the years I have been lifting. These pictures you see here on your screen paint a thousand words and show real hard work and dedication. Rome wasn't built in a day and fitness goals take a very long time to reach. As a result I now have superb patience and discipline in regards to all aspects of my life compared to before my fitness journey. Take what you want from my fitness journey but if you are to take anything just remember this. Fitness plays a huge role in how my mental state has even been able to bring me to being able to study computer science and I do truly believe that without it I would not have had the determination to study hard and get into this course or even be making this website as I type.
