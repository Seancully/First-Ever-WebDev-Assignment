                <h3>Push/Pull/Legs Workout Split</h3>
                <p>
                    The push/pull/legs workout program allows every muscle group to be hit twice in the one week allowing also a minimum of two days rest and recovery for each muscle group too. This is the current workout programme that I have been taking myself for the past probably 18 months. It can be divided into three different sections;
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>(1) Push</h4>
                <p>
                    This is generally  the first day of the training block. the 'push day' hits the chest, triceps and shoulders. It is called the 'push' day simply because all three of these muscle groups can be simultaneously worked together. They are all linked in the various different pushing exercises. An example of this would be the bench press, this is a pushing movement and it targets primarily the chest but also too, the triceps and shoulders. Push day's mainly consist of primarily exercises that isolates all three muscle groups so that they can then recover together and get equal amounts of rest and recovery before they are trained again. 
                </p>
                <h4>(2) Pull</h4>
                <p>
                    Pull day's are my personal favourite. They are generally trained the next day after a push workout. The 'pull day' hits the back and biceps but I personally like adding in some rear deltoid and also trap action into the mix. These are two muscle groups that are often forgotten about, however they make up a huge amount of difference when they are after being trained to the same standard of the rest of your muscle groups. An example of a pull day exercise that hits both the biceps and back would be a lat pulldown. It is a pulling movement as are all in a pull day and so, hits the lats (back) and too, biceps.
                </p>
                <H4>(3) Legs </H4>
                <p>
                    Leg day's are often neglected by many new lifters, they usually when beginning only want a bigger upper body. However as many of them soon come to realise the legs look quite ridiculous when not trained to the same extent of the upper body muscle groups. hence it is very important to train your legs. A good combination of quad, hamstring and calf exercises need to be incorporated into everyone's leg day. this is why leg day on this workout program is the only muscle group that has a single day dedicated solely to one muscle group. The legs make up such a huge part of our bodies so it is vital they get the training needed.
